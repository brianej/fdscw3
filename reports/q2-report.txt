Question - can see a weird thing happening for non clinial reason increasing during the 
winter months, check using statiscial inference if month december have the
 same number of non clinical reason cancellation. should be not, found on research paper, maybe go and also check with other reasons

Answer - The first thing to be analysed is if there exists any relationship between the type of cancellation and the season, to test this we will be performing
chi square test.
Null hypothesis: No relationship the type of cancellation and the season in which it took place.
This would mean that the number of cancellations per cancellation type per season should match or slightly differ from the expected values.
For starters we take the scotland cancellations dataframe and take add a new column called seasons which would include the season in which the cancellation took place 
, depending on the month it happened.
We then take away the unnecessary columns.
to then group the types of cancellation within all 4 seasons and sum all the values to then get the total number of values per injury type per season
with all this information in hand we can construct the contingency table and perform the chi square test.

After performing the chi square test in the contingency table we can observe that the p value is 4.66179921136406e-49 meaning that it's safe to reject the 
null hypothesis, meaning that there exists a relationship between season and cancellation type
